This repository contains a Python-based  Face Recognition project a type of machine learning or deep learning model designed to identify or verify a person's identity by analyzing and comparing facial features in images or videos. These models are widely used in applications like security systems, user authentication, social media tagging, and more.

** Objective:

Develop a secure and efficient face recognition system.

Implement a user-friendly interface for data capture, training, and recognition.

Integrate the system into a specific use case, such as access control, attendance monitoring, or user authentication.
 ** Features:

1. Real-Time Face Detection and Recognition:
Ability to process live video feeds or images and identify faces within milliseconds.


2. Database Management:
Maintain a database of known faces and corresponding IDs for recognition.


3. Scalability:
Handle large datasets of faces for enterprise-level applications.


4. Performance Metrics:
Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and speed to optimize the system for high performance.

** Programming Languages: Python

** Libraries and Frameworks:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV library
- NumPy library
- A pre-trained face model from Google Teachable Machine

>> Step5: Click on Export the Model.

>> Step6: Under the tensorflow tab, select Download the model option. And a .zip file would be downloaded. 


>> Step8: To run it in local system, paste the Given code in pycharm or any other code Interpreter.

>> Step9: Open the .zip file and copy the .h5 file and .txt file. And the save the files to the project path to Run the code.

>> Step10: Open the terminal and install the required libraries for the project.
Tip-- chech the right python versions and tensorflow versions to avoid the syntax errors.

>> Step11: Run the code and, Hence the facefinder+ works.
